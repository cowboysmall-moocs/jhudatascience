Developing Data Products Project
================================

## Introduction

within the project directory there are three sub-directories relating to the project:

* titanic_analysis - where the exploratory data analysis and model fitting is documented
* titanic_app - where the files relating to the shiny app are located
* titanic_presentation - where the files relating to the slidify presentation are located

## App

the shiny app is located [here](https://cowboysmall.shinyapps.io/titanic_app/)

## Presentation

the slidify presentation is located [here](https://cowboysmall.github.io/pages/devdataprod/) 
and [here](http://rpubs.com/cowboysmall/62980)

__NOTE:__ the location of the presentation on RPubs has changed - there was a conflict problem 
between the slidify deployment and the RStudio which resulted in the presentation being deleted. 
I re-deployed it, but it was to a different url, so the link above is up-to-date. Sorry for the 
inconvenience.
